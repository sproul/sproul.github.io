    I don't expect anyone to read this unless there is a problem. If there is a problem, please don't hesitate to call Nelson at (209) 677-7685.

There are five separate Wi-Fi access points in the house:
<ul>
    <li>adyn_pep</li>
    <li>adyn</li>
    <li>adyn3</li>
    <li>adyn4</li>
    <li>adyn5</li>
</ul>
They all have the same password -- <b>ahagander</b> -- but these are separate LANs. So if you have multiple devices which need to share a LAN (e.g., a laptop and a portable printer), be sure to connect them to the same named network or else they will not work.
<p>
adyn3, adyn4 and adyn5 are plug-in WiFi networks. Normally adyn3 lives in the rear bedroom.  adyn4 and adyn5 are usually plugged in upstairs, but can be moved if you prefer. They also accept ethernet if you have wired devices.
<p>
All the networks depend on the Comcast cable modem and the adyn_pep router. The adyn network depends also on the adyn linksys router.  adyn3, adyn4 and adyn5 also depend on their own internal routers.
<p>
The plug-in routers can be restarted simply by pulling them out of the wall and reinserting them.
<p>
The other routers and modem live on the machine shelf:

Remove the machine shelf cover:

Do not touch any of the wiring. Use the labeled power strips at the bottom to restart the adyn router, the adyn_pep router or the comcast modem.
