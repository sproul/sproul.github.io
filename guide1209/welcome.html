<h4>Welcome to 1209 Glen Ave.</h4>
The key is in the lock box mounted on the left side of the front door.  The code is 8.  There are more details in the <a href='lockbox.html'>on-line lockbox guide</a> should you have trouble.
<p>
There are other on-line guides for a few topics related to staying in the house.  The information is not terribly exciting, but if you want you can read it in one shot from the <a href='index.html'>main 1209 Glen guide page</a>.  Alternatively you can wait until you have a question, and in many cases the object in question will have a sticker with a URL and a QR code like the following:<br>

You can either go to the URL on your computer or use a QR code reader to navigate there automatically using your phone.
