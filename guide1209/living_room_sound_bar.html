    The sound is controlled by the sound bar remote control only:<br>

The reason that we disabled the TV speakers is that their sound is lower quality, and it is slightly out of sync with the sound bar, leading to an echoing effect.

Note that the sound bar powers off if it is not used for a few minutes.

You can also use the sound bar as a speaker for your phone by linking to it over Bluetooth. Depress the Bluetooth button to get the sound bar into pairing mode:<br>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
Is it powered on?  Since it turns off automatically after a few minutes of no use, be sure it really is turned on.  When it is on, a white light is visible in the sound bar's lower left corner:

Is the INPUT set correctly?  There are unfortunately several inputs to this device, even though only one of them is ever used.  Since there is only one input, it doesn't make sense to hit the "INPUT" button, but occasionally someone does this, and the result is a silent sound bar.  Since there is no visual display for the soundbar, you must repeatedly hit the "INPUT" button again, each time waiting a second or so for the sound to come back.  Beware: if you quickly cycle through, the sound bar will remain silent, i.e., it doesn't immediately switch as you hit the button.  There are 6 settings for "INPUT", so if someone hits it once, you'll need to advance 5 times through the input settings before you are back to normal.
