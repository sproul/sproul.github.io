    The sound is controlled by the sound bar remote control only:<br>

The reason that we disabled the TV speakers is that their sound is lower quality, and it is slightly out of sync with the sound bar, leading to an echoing effect.

You can also use the sound bar as a speaker for your phone by linking to it over Bluetooth. Depress the Bluetooth button to get the sound bar into pairing mode:<br>
