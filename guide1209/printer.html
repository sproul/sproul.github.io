<h4>1209 Glen Printer</h4>
The printer is under the desk in the front living room. It is a Canon MF229dw, and should be discoverable on the adyn_pep network. It can be used directly from any Windows, Mac or smart phone.
<p>
Following are the steps to use it from a Windows 7 machine. (Hopefully the experience is a little less of a headache in more modern operating systems!)
<p>
If your operating system does not already have a driver for the Canon MF229dw, then navigate to the <a href='https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/black-and-white-laser/mf229dw'>Canon MF229dw printer driver download page</a>, click <b>Drivers and Downloads</b> and then select the "MFDrivers" file and download it and run it.  Windows will want to confirm your desire to do this:

Click Run and the Canon installer will appear:

Agree to the license:
<br><img src='canon_agree.png'/><br>
Relax the firewall in order to let the driver installer find the printer on the network:

You will be using a network connection to talk to this printer:

Wait a few seconds for the printer to be found:
<br><img src='canon_scan.png'/><br>
You have found it:
<br><img src='canon_found.png'/><br>
Choose the appropriate drivers -- there is no landline connection, so the fax driver is not useful:

Choose the printer drivers:
<br><img src='canon_choose_printer_drivers.png'/><br>
Choose the XPS driver (which I understand is a slightly higher quality printer driver not supported by all applications):
<br><img src='canon_confirm_XPS.png'/><br>
Confirm that you really want to do this. Whoever implemented this interface must have been paid by the screen...

Wait a minute for the installation finish.

And welcome to the world of printing in glorious black and white.
