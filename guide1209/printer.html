The printer is under the desk in the front living room. It is a Canon MF229dw, and should be discoverable on the adyn_pep network. It can be used directly from any Windows, Mac or smart phone.
<p>
Following are the steps to use it from a Windows 7 machine. (Hopefully the experience is a little less of a headache in more modern operating systems!)
<p>
If your operating system does not already have a driver for the Canon MF229dw, then navigate to <a href='https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/black-and-white-laser/mf229dw'>the Canon MF229dw printer driver download page</a>, where you can specify your operating system and download their latest driver:

Once you have downloaded it, run it (and confirm your desire to do this):

<br><img src='canon_welcome.png'/><br>
Agree to the license:
<br><img src='canon_agree.png'/><br>
Relax the firewall in order to let the driver installer find the printer on the network:
<br><img src='canon_firewall.png'/><br>
You will be using a network connection to talk to this printer:

Wait a few seconds for the printer to be found:
<br><img src='canon_scan.png'/><br>
You have found it:
<br><img src='canon_found.png'/><br>
Choose the appropriate drivers -- there is no landline connection, so the fax driver is not useful:

Choose the printer drivers:
<br><img src='canon_choose_printer_drivers.png'/><br>
Choose the XPS driver (which I understand is a slightly higher quality printer driver which is not supported by all applications):
<br><img src='canon_confirm_XPS.png'/><br>
Confirm that you really want to do this. Whoever implemented this interface must have been paid by the screen...

And welcome to the beautiful world of printing in glorious black and white.
