        <h4>1209 Glen play room sound bar</h4>
    The sound is controlled by the sound bar remote control only:<br>

The reason that we disabled the TV speakers is that their sound is lower quality, and it is slightly out of sync with the sound bar, leading to an echoing effect.

Note that the sound bar powers off if it is not used for a few minutes.

You can also use the sound bar as a speaker for your phone by linking to it over Bluetooth. Depress the sound bar remote Bluetooth button to get the sound bar into pairing mode:<br>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
Is it powered on?  Since it turns off automatically after a few minutes of no use, be sure it really is turned on.  When it is on, a white light is (barely!) visible in the sound bar's lower left corner:

<p>
Is the INPUT set correctly?  There are unfortunately several inputs to this device, even though we only use one of them.  Since there is only one input, it doesn't make sense to hit the "INPUT" button, but occasionally someone does this, and the result is a silent sound bar.  Since there is no visual status display for the soundbar, there is no way to tell if this is why you are hearing nothing.  To fix it, you must repeatedly hit the "INPUT" button again, each time waiting a second or so for the sound to come back.  Beware: if you quickly cycle through, you may miss the correct setting because the sound doesn't immediately switch on when you hit the button, rather there is a delay of a second or so.  There are 6 settings for "INPUT", so if someone hits it once, you'll need to advance 5 times through the input settings before you are back to normal.
