This problem is solved by public-key cryptography. Public-key cryptography ensures secure communication by protecting important and valuable information from attacks, such as sniffing, spoofing, and tampering of data as it flows over a network.¶Key Pair¶¶ ¶A key pair consists of a public key and a secret key, both of which are required for encrypting or decrypting data. Because data that has been encrypted with one of the key pair cannot be returned to its original data form without the other, public-key cryptography ensures secure communication of data over the network. Up to three key pairs can be registered (Using CA-issued Key Pairs and Digital Certificates). On this machine, you can also perform &quot;Generate Network Communication Key&quot; and &quot;Generate Key and Certificate Signing Request (CSR)&quot; (Generating Key Pairs).¶¶CA Certificate¶¶ ¶Digital certificates including CA certificates are similar to other forms of identification, such as driver's licenses. A digital certificate contains a digital signature, which enables the machine to detect any spoofing or tampering of data. It is extremely difficult for third parties to abuse digital certificates. A digital certificate that contains a public key of a certification authority (CA) is referred to as a CA certificate. CA certificates are used for verifying the device the machine is communicating with for features such as printing with AirPrint. Up to three CA certificates can be registered (Using CA-issued Key Pairs and Digital Certificates).¶¶Key and Certificate Requirements¶The certificate contained in a key pair generated with the machine conforms to X.509v3. If you install a key pair or a CA certificate from a computer, make sure that they meet the following requirements:¶Format¶Key pair: PKCS#12*1¶CA certificate: X.509v1 or X.509v3, DER (encoded binary)¶File extension¶Key pair: &quot;.p12&quot; , &quot;.pfx&quot; or &quot;.cer&quot;¶CA certificate: &quot;.p12&quot; , &quot;.pfx&quot; or &quot;.cer&quot;¶Public key algorithm (and key length)¶RSA (512 bits, 1024 bits, 2048 bits, or 4096 bits)¶Certificate signature algorithm¶SHA1-RSA, SHA256-RSA, SHA384-RSA*2 or SHA512-RSA*2¶Certificate thumbprint algorithm¶SHA1¶*1 Requirements for the certificate contained in a key pair are pursuant to CA certificates.¶*2 SHA384-RSA and SHA512-RSA are available only when the RSA key length is 1024 bits or more.¶¶¶The machine does not support use of a certificate revocation list (CRL).¶¶¶",category:"06000000",title:"Configuring Settings for Key Pairs and Digital Certificates",keywords:""},{toc_id:"09040040_010",body:"0L8U-04A¶Generating Key Pairs¶A key pair can be generated with the machine when it is required for encrypted communication via Transport Layer Security (TLS).

For example, if snow on a photograph image is bluish, click this part because you essentially want to render this part as white. When you click this part, the snow is no longer bluish, and the entire image is adjusted so that it comes closer to natural colors. Click different parts little by little while checking the preview image to produce the optimum color tone.¶ (Tone Curve Settings)¶ ¶¶ ¶The tone curve is a curved line that indicates the brightness and contrast levels of the image before and after adjustment.

If your wireless router is equipped with Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), configuring your network is automatic and easy. If your networking devices do not support automatic configuration, or if you want to specify authentication and encryption settings in detail, you need to manually set up the connection. Make sure that your computer is correctly connected to the network.¶¶Setting Up Connection Using WPS¶Manually Setting Up Connection¶¶Risk of information leak¶Use wireless LAN connection at your own discretion and at your own risk. If the machine is connected to an unsecured network, your personal information might be leaked to a third party because radio waves used in wireless communication can go anywhere nearby, even beyond walls.¶Wireless LAN security¶The wireless LAN security that is supported by the machine is listed below.

This is a must-read for all users and administrators before using this machine, other printers, and multifunction machines connected to the network. In recent years, a printer/multifunction machine connected to the network can offer you a variety of useful functions, such as printing from a computer, operating from a computer using the remote function, and sending scanned documents via the Internet. On the other hand, it is essential to take security measures to reduce the security risk for information leakage, as a printer/multifunction machine has become more exposed to threats, such as unauthorized access and theft, when it is connected to the network. This section explains necessary settings you need to specify to prevent unauthorized access before using a printer/multifunction machine connected to the network. ¶Security Measures to Prevent Unauthorized Access from the External Network ¶Assigning a Private IP Address¶Using Firewall to Restrict Transmission¶Specifying the TLS Encrypted Communication ¶Setting PIN to Manage Information Stored in the Multifunction Machine¶Assigning a Private IP Address¶An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network. A &quot;global IP address&quot; is used for the communication connecting to the Internet, and a &quot;private IP address&quot; is used for the communication within a local area network, such as a LAN in the company. If a global IP address is assigned, your printer/multifunction machine is open to the public and can be accessed via the Internet. Thus, the risk of information leakage due to unauthorized access from external network increases. On the other hand, if a private IP address is assigned, your printer/multifunction machine is closed to a local area network and can be accessed by only users on your local area network, such as a LAN in the company. ¶¶¶Global IP Address¶Can be accessed from the users within a local area network¶Private IP Address ¶Can be accessed from the users within a local area network¶¶Basically, assign a private IP address to your printer/multifunction machine. Make sure to confirm the IP address, assigned to the printer/multifunction machine you are using, is a private IP address or not. A private IP address is found in one of the following ranges. ¶Ranges for Private IP addresses ¶From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255¶From 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255¶From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255¶For information on how to confirm the IP address, see Setting IPv4 Address.¶¶If a global IP address is assigned to a printer/multifunction machine, you can create a network environment to reduce the risk of unauthorized access by installing security software, such as a firewall that prevents access from the external networks. If you want to assign a global IP address to and use a printer/multifunction machine, contact your network administrator. ¶¶Using Firewall to Restrict Transmission¶A firewall is a system that prevents unauthorized access from the external networks and protects against attacks/intrusions to a local area network. You can use a firewall on your network environment to block access from the external network that appears to be dangerous, by restricting communication from specified IP address of the external network. The function installed to a Canon printer/multifunction machine enables you to set up the IP address filter. For information on how to set up an IP address filter, see Specifying IP Addresses for Firewall Rules.¶Specifying the TLS Encrypted Communication ¶For information on the TLS Encrypted Communication, see Encrypting Communication of Print Data for Apple Devices with TLS. ¶Setting PIN to Manage Information Stored in the Multifunction Machine¶If a malicious third party attempts to gain unauthorized access to a printer/multifunction machine, setting PIN to information stored in the machine will reduce the risk of information leakage. Canon printer/multifunction machine enables you to protect various type of information by setting PIN.¶Setting PIN to Each Function¶Setting PIN for Using Remote UI For more information, see Setting a Remote UI PIN.¶Setting PIN for the System Manager Settings For more information, see Setting the System Manager PIN.¶Address Book PIN For more information on setting a PIN, see Setting a PIN for Address Book.¶Listed above are some examples of security measures for preventing unauthorized access.
