<h4>1209 Glen fastrak</h4>

If you plan on driving across any bridges during your stay, use the FasTrak transponder to avoid lines of cars waiting to pay cash.  To use it, 
<ul>
    <li>let me know your car's license plate state and number, so I can associate your car with the transponder</li>
    <li>place the device in the middle of your dashboard</li>
    <li>when you check out, leave it on the piece of furniture by the front door</li>
</ul>
If you have three or more people in your car (including the driver) and you are crossing the Bay Bridge <b>between 5am and 10am on a weekday</b>, be sure to use the carpool lane to bypass the toll plaza altogether -- on a busy day this route will save you 40 minutes.  To get to the bypass, 
<ul>
    <li>get into the far left carpool lane on 80 as you head south in Berkeley</li>
    <li>use the leftmost lane marked "San Francisco" to take the flyover toward the bridge</li>
    <li>take the first right exit marked "BUSES ONLY"</li>
</ul>
Note that this is not legal if it is not <b>between 5am and 10am on a weekday</b>.
